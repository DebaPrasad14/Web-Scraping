# Web-Scraping
Extracting data from newyork times website and exporting them to CSV  files.
Here I have extracted data from - https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html

Using python, python pandas and BeautifulSoup , I scrape data (Lies of Trump's) from the above site 
and showing it as below tabular form and then exporting them to a CSV file.
